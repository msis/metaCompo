------------
To use metaCompo, you'll need to have Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and the acceleo plugins.
A youtube video (raw and not edited yet) is availble here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp22cuPmP2o . Another one, shorter and with comments, will be released soon.

Examples

Please find a VHDL conversion script in /metaCompo.gen and two examples of models in metaCompo.model
